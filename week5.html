		<h3> Reading Responses</h3>
		<p> <b>Radical Technologies </b>
			The beginning of the reading talks about how a person found a dead body playing Pokemon Go- she found a body present in two places at once. What makes Pokemon Go so unique is that it presents plays with an alternative reality in which monsters of various types inhabit the Earth and you must be physically occupying the place where the in-game maps says to the monsters are at whereas other applications mostly use this overlay to provide pragmatic information. Overall, I think that it is important to critically think about the intended purpose and consequences when designing for AR.It’s important to think about the physical space and the surveillance that comes along with it.

  <p><b>The Poetics of Augmented Space,</b>
- Manovich discusses how people experience spacial forms when they are filled in with dynamic and rich multimedia information.
- He defines “augmented space” as the physical space overlaid with dynamically changing information, multimedia in form and localized for each user.
- The author asks the question ,”Does this form become irrelevant and invisible or do people end up with a new experience in which spacial and informational layers are equally important?”
- I think that his lists of technological application that dynamically deliver data to, or extract data from, physical space is interesting. His list includes video surveillance, cell space technologies which include the GPS, and computer/video displays. He states that these things make physical space into a data space:extracting data from it(surveillance) or augmenting it with data(cell space, computer displays).
- Also discusses how the surveillance and the augmentation of this space with addition data are in a symbiotic relationship because if you know the location of a person equipped with a cell phone, you can send them particular information relevant to that specific location via their cellphone. He also mentions that by tracking the users - with their mood, pattern of work, focus attention, and interests - these interfaces acquire information about the users which they then use to automatically perform tasks on them. This makes me think about the limitless possibilities for the future.

    <p><b>Situated Computing,</b>
This reading discusses the concepts of situatedness and constructive memory as the foundations of situated computing. The fundamental difference is between encoding all knowledge prior to its use and allowing the knowledge to be developed and grounded in the interaction between the tool and its environment.
