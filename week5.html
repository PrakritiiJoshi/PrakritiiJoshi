		<p> <b>The Poetics of Augmented Space, </b>

  <p><b>Radical Technologies,</b>
- Manovich discusses how people experience spacial forms when they are filled in with dynamic and rich multimedia information.
- He defines “augmented space” as the physical space overlaid with dynamically changing information, multimedia in form and localized for each user.
- The author asks the question ,”Does this form become irrelevant and invisible or do people end up with a new experience in which spacial and informational layers are equally important?”
- I think that his lists of technological application that dynamically deliver data to, or extract data from, physical space is interesting. His list includes video surveillance, cell space technologies which include the GPS, and computer/video displays. He states that these things make physical space into a data space:extracting data from it(surveillance) or augmenting it with data(cell space, computer displays).
- Also discusses how the surveillance and the augmentation of this space with addition data are in a symbiotic relationship because if you know the location of a person equipped with a cell phone, you can send them particular information relevant to that specific location via their cellphone. He also mentions that by tracking the users - with their mood, pattern of work, focus attention, and interests - these interfaces acquire information about the users which they then use to automatically perform tasks on them. This makes me think about the limitless possibilities for the future.
