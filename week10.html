    <h3>Reading Response  </h3>
    <p>The Ignorant Art Museum: Beyond Meaning Making- This reading explores how technology can explore the ignorant museum as a strategy for change. Museums are looking for a museum that will be more accessible and represented by different cultures. Art museums have the potential to be progressive. Museums, and particularly art museums, are perceived as learning spaces where the knowledge produced is not reduced to the acquisition of information but also encompasses the development of diverse individual cognitive skills, such as analytical or critical skills, diverse individual emotional skills, such as empathy or creativity, a variety of psychomotor skills, such as looking at and moving around artworks, as well as social skills related to communication or normative museum behaviour. Knowledge production in art museums is about giving the public the ability to acquire skills to generate further knowledge. Hein proposed four educational models for museums:
•	the didactic/expository model where knowledge exists outside the learner and the learner learns incrementally,				
•	the discovery model where knowledge exists outside the learner but the learner construct her/his own knowledge,				
•	the stimulus-response model where knowledge is created by the learner and the learner learns incrementally,				
•	and the constructivist model where the learner constructs her/his own knowledge and knowledge is created by the learner				
The Ian Potter Museum of Art at the University of Melbourne, Australia, created an app ‘FLoat’ that focuses on emotional engagement with the artworks. It uses geo-location (WiFi fingerprinting) to ask visitors to share their emotions linked to their interaction with specific artworks. The app allows every visitor to see what other visitors have shared. While it limits the visibility of the knowledge created to emotional knowledge and is still relatively unidirectional, it provides a starting point for further knowledge development, using the artwork as the ‘thing in common’. Curator Francesco Manacorda puts the idea of co-creation of the visual display at the core of his practice. He notes that ‘if we want a museum of commons, we cannot design it to involve the public. We need to design it with the public. I really like this idea and think that it is an interesting concept that goes along with the constructivist model.  </p>
