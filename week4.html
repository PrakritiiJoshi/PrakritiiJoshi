		<h2> Week 4- Augmenting Objects</h2>
		<p>...</p>
		<h3> Reading Responses</h3>
		<p> <b>Artefacts</b>
- Artefacts are different than words because artifacts are a means by which we give form to, and come to an understanding of, ourselves, others, or abstractions such as the nation or the modern. When we talk about the meaning of things we are primarily concerned with question of reference. 
- The order of things-ordering things
- Systematic collections- patterns of affinity were sought which could then be analyzed in conjunction with consistent theories of their connectivity.
- The order of things is also culturally constructed- an object is always perceived in terms of its ability to transform into or elicit another object: a tool is the potential creator of garden crops. Objects are thus viewed less in themselves than for their place in an exchange or ritual which will have an effect.
Overall, artefacts appear as given concrete forms, but human societies have always striven—through their construction, alteration, consumption and application of meaning—to make them internal to, and in part definitional of, themselves. In many ways it is the very physical nature of artefacts, at once the product of human desires, yet in themselves inanimate, which will always render them ambiguous as regards the dualism between persons and non-persons. It is intrinsic to their nature as social things. </p>

  <p><b>DOING CULTURE STUDIES</b>
- The author defines culture saying that it is used to refer to the particular and distinctive way of life of particular groups, peoples, nations or periods. However, Williams calls social definition of culture in which culture is a description of a particular way of life which expresses certain meanings and values not only in art and learning but also in institutions and ordinary behavior. I agree with Williams in that the connection between culture, meaning, and communication is extremely important.  
- Walter Benjamin argued that the infinite repeatability due to new technologies is one of the modern means of cultural production. We used to depend on the uniqueness of art and now the scope has been vastly increased which has opened up a new frontier in modern culture life and completely transformed the process of “meaning-making” - the interface between culture and technology.
