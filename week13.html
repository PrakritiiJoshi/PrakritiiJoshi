		<h2> Week 13 - Exhibiting Digital Artworks </h2>
		<p>...</p>
	<h3>Assignment  </h3>
		<p> Write an update regarding your Collection Activation assignment (what further research have you done, what wireframes have you made, etc.) </p>
    <p> Update for Collection Activation assignment: I have decided to focus my project as AR App used in classrooms for learning about history and culture. The database I am using sorts the paintings by time period and my app will allow the students to see the paintings where they are in their surrounds so they can learn about the artwork based on the time period. The users will also be able to add more contextual information with a notes feature in the app. One technical feature I have decided to work on is to make sure that the scale of the artwork is proportional to the space the user is in.    </p>

    <h3>Reading Response  </h3></h2>
  <p>Presenting and Preserving New Media-I think it’s interesting to note that the biggest challenges for the presentation of new media art is to engage the audience for a period of time that is long enough to allow a piece to reveal its content.
1. Presentation Models- The presentation of Internet art within the museum or gallery space raises some additional questions. Net art has been created to be seen by anyone, anywhere, anytime (provided one has access to the network) and does not necessarily need a museum to be presented or introduced to the public. While net art exists within a (virtual) public space, it seems to be particularly difficult to “connect” it to the public space of a gallery. 
2. Collaborative Models and Platforms of Exchange- The inherent nature of new media projects and the collaborative processes employed in their creation, curation, and presentation make it obvious that — in order to write a history of new media and preserve the art itself — it will be necessary to develop new models and criteria for documenting and preserving process and instability.I agree it is important for preserving process. I also think the physical space when recreating a museum space as a platform is crucial.
 </p>
  <p>Collecting Experience: The Multiple Incarnations of Very Nervous System- In this reading the author analyzes the relationship between audience experience and artist intent through the process of recording and listening to audience’s descriptions of their own experiences. The author explains that the developments in technology including social, portable, and locative media, offer new opportunities for the audience’s voice and opinions to be documented. He argues that it is important to remember that the digital archives created to preserve the fleeting experiential aspects of new media art share with those words a fundamental instability. </p>
