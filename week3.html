		<h2> Week 3 - Interaction Technology</h2>
		<p>...</p>
	<h3> Assignment </h3>
		<p>Prompt-
		Develop an AR application which allows your user to position at least 6 different objects around the physical world. Half of those objects should be positioned on user-input </p>
		

	<video width="1280" height="720" controls>
			<source src = "med.mp4" type=video/mp4>

		<h3> Reading Responses</h3>
		<p> <b>What is Interaction Design?</b>
Usability in terms of design principles - to help designers by telling them what to provide and what to avoid. 
Visibility - The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next. 
Feedback- Sending back information about what action has been done and what action has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. 
Constraints- determining ways of restricting the kind of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. 
Mapping- the relationship between controls and their effects in the world.
Consistency - designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks.
Easy for the users to learn and use. </p>

I agree that it is difficult to design a more complex platform with a lot of different functions because the more functions and components, the harder it is to make it consistent. I think organizing the content by card sorting and site mapping before you try to design the platform is the best way to figure out a structure for a consistent design
Affordance - an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. Norman argues that screens don’t have real affordances because it is not physical instead interfaces can have perceived affordances which are learned conventions. 
I have read the design of everything in my UX class I took last semester. However, I don’t normally think about interaction design with augmented reality and the more I’m learning about augmented reality the more I have been thinking about interaction design in a completely different way than I normally think about when designing for mobile and web platforms. This is because when designing for AR you also have to think about the physical space around you and the fact that AR uses objects as possible buttons that enables the users to intuitively follow rather than just clicking static buttons on a screen.

  <p><b>A Cultural Approach to Interaction Design</b>
“To see any artifact as part of culture is to understand how it becomes meaningful through the social activities, thoughts, and actions of the people who engage with it. “ 
I agree with Murray when she states that we are making too many things too quickly, with the result that as users of the devices we often feel overwhelmed and unable to take appropriate advantage of the opportunity they offer us. I agree with this because often I am learning about a new feature or shortcut that I have never heard of before. Especially because there are also a lot of new updates that change the user interface. So once I’m finally used to something it changes and I have to get used to something else. Murray also talks about designing for new media and the challenges that come along with it. She explains that a better design value than intuitive is transparent as it should not stand out but rather direct our attention to the task. Throughout this reading she goes through important HCI terms and explains the purpose of them which was really helpful in getting a better understanding of human interaction.

  <p><b>The Rhetoric of Video Games</b>
Bogost argues that video games are not just stages that facilitate cultural, social, or political practices, they are also media where cultural values themselves can be represented - for critique, satire, education, or commentary. I thought it was interesting when Bogost describes space in a video game as he says that the possibility of space refers to the myriad configurations the player might construct to see the ways the processes inscribed in the system work. Especially because in AR it is important to think about the different spaces you are in and how the objects interact with those spaces. Also similar to the reading above he talks about new media as cultural artifacts and says that like cultural artifacts, no video game is produced in a cultural vacuum. All bear the biases of their creators. This shows that it is up to the greater to depict the idea they want to spread to others.
