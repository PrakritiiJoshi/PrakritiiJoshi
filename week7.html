		<h2> Week 7- Role of Museums</h2>
		<p>...</p>
	<h3>Assignment  </h3>
		<p>about the use-case you are working on, explaining why you're interested in them, and giving at least three options of how you could envision augmenting them.
    </p>
    <p>
	   Ceremonial House of the Abelam

The object is a reconstruction
It has many parts from different areas and different times
It is not used for everyday life only for special occasions

The front part is important for everyday life because the faces in three rows are spirits and gods.
There are five initiations- they take places in the chambers

Problems:
- limited view of the objects
- lack of contextualizing material(collection)
    - Animation
- Lack of interaction(visitors)


Important Features:
- Tp expand the narrative and the visitors experience
- Engaging by reinforcing the experience of the object and face to face communication

Low Fidelity Prototype:
Guide Screen- Controls the options of what to show
Visitor: Looks at the object through iPad to show the AR

IDEAS: 

Improvement of experience through visitor interaction
- Construction game
	    - showing the inside of the house
	    - Adding animation to objects

		<h3> Reading Responses</h3>
		<p> <b>Key Concepts of Museology</b>
			In this reading the author discusses key concepts in museology in alphabetical order. First the author defines the concepts and then gives an explanation. The author first discusses architecture- which is defines as the art of designing and installing or building a space that will be used those specific museum functions. The form and function of a museum is important. The second concept is collection which is defined as a a set of material or intangible objects which an individual or an establishment has assembled, classified, selected, and preserved in a safe setting. Third, the author discusses communication as a key concept which I think is the most interesting and defines it as the action of conveying information between one or several emitters and one or several receivers through a channel. The author goes on to discuss the chronic lack of interactivity in museum communication which leads to questions on how people can make the visitor more active while seeking participation. I think one crucial way to do this is by implementing technology so the visitors can have more options and control more of what they want to see.

  <p> <b>The End of the Museum?</b>
	  This reading talks about the museumâ€™s mission as educational and for public use- similar to a library. However, there are differences as visitors in a museum do not know how to see the works there and the works in a museum must be viewed under severe and stultifying restraints whereas a library is much more straightforward to users since they know how to read the books there. The author argues that a museum has to function as an institution for the prevention and cure of blindness ignorer to make works work and goes on to talk about the obstacles it faces. First is that what we take from a museum heavily depends on what we bring to it: upon relevant experience and skills involved in our looking. Second, is that the circumstances for viewing in a museum are abnormal and limited. Third, is the timelessness of most works in a museum- attention muse be help long enough for a work to work. One method I think that is important that the author discusses is to make available all sorts of help: informative labels, easily accessible photographs and books, live or recorded talks, film and videotapes, and whatever else may hold and guide attention.

  <p> <b>Museums in the Digital Age</b>
This reading talks about the developments in mobile and location-based technologies, including virtual and augmented reality which allow us to talk about the transference of place in the digital age. Sociologist uses the term portable communities which are groupings that use small, wireless, easily transportable technologies of communication to facilitate interpersonal connectedness and to make and share a collective identity and culture. Two reasons why place has receded for the modern museum is due to technology and the other is due to the primacy of experience.
