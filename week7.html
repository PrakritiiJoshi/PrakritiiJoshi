		<h3> Reading Responses</h3>
		<p> <b>Key Concepts of Museology</b>
			In this reading the author discusses key concepts in museology in alphabetical order. First the author defines the concepts and then gives an explanation. The author first discusses architecture- which is defines as the art of designing and installing or building a space that will be used those specific museum functions. The form and function of a museum is important. The second concept is collection which is defined as a a set of material or intangible objects which an individual or an establishment has assembled, classified, selected, and preserved in a safe setting. Third, the author discusses communication as a key concept which I think is the most interesting and defines it as the action of conveying information between one or several emitters and one or several receivers through a channel. The author goes on to discuss the chronic lack of interactivity in museum communication which leads to questions on how people can make the visitor more active while seeking participation. I think one crucial way to do this is by implementing technology so the visitors can have more options and control more of what they want to see.
