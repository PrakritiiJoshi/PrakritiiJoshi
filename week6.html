		<p> <b>Museum4Punkt0, </b>

<p>
	The author first discusses the thematic scope of “digital” projects or applications in museums. I think that it is important to note that digitalizing museums will make them more accessible and will thus allow for a larger audience as well as a more efficient way to share the information in museums. The author also talks about how digital technologies are used to communicate relevant Information to the public which can also be through social networking sites which allows engagement in public conversations. 
Then she introduces the participating institutions within museum4punkt0 and their related specific use case.  This project focuses on visitors, knowledge transfer, and public outreach and hence corresponds to the museum’s purpose of exhibiting and communicating. This project takes a research-oriented approach when developing digital applications in the museum context. She presents the range of objectives and use cases to highlight the project to develop a variety of reusable prototypes that are applicable to a broad range of museums.  I thought the use case at Deutsches Auswandererhaus was interesting and unique as their objective is to understand how digital communication tools and immersive environments can help convey subjective, biographic, and emotional aspects of emigration. This is interesting because it is focused on storytelling and interaction using mixed reality.
